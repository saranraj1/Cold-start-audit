# Cold Start Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This audit quantifies the "Data Hunger" of machine learning architectures, specifically comparing a high-variance model (Random Forest) against a high-bias baseline (Linear Regression) on the California Housing dataset.

**Key Findings:**
- **Crossover Point**: The Random Forest model begins to outperform Linear Regression at **n = 250** training samples.
- **Micro-Data Performance**: Below 250 samples, the complex model (Random Forest) underperforms the simple baseline, confirming the "Complexity Tax".
- **Saturation Trajectory**: The Random Forest model exhibits a Power Law learning curve with a learning rate (alpha) of **0.2010** and a theoretical irreducible error floor of **$21,036**.

## 2. Methodology
- **Dataset**: California Housing Prices (20,640 samples, 8 features).
- **Models Audited**:
    - **Golden Model (Model B)**: Random Forest Regressor (n_estimators=100)
    - **Baseline Challenger (Model A)**: Linear Regression
- **Audit Process**:
    - Models were trained on subsets of data ranging from n=50 to n=10,000.
    - Performance was measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a hold-out test set.
    - Learning curves were analyzed to detect crossover points and saturation limits.

## 3. Scarcity Simulation Results
The following table summarizes the performance (MAE) of both models across various data milestones:

| Training Samples (n) | Random Forest MAE ($) | Linear Regression MAE ($) | Leading Model |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 50                   | $61,720               | **$58,956**               | Linear Reg.   |
| 100                  | $54,046               | **$52,578**               | Linear Reg.   |
| 250                  | **$49,723**           | $52,029                   | Random Forest |
| 500                  | **$45,381**           | $51,839                   | Random Forest |
| 1,000                | **$43,777**           | $51,182                   | Random Forest |
| 2,500                | **$40,104**           | $50,999                   | Random Forest |
| 5,000                | **$36,619**           | $50,819                   | Random Forest |
| 10,000               | **$33,969**           | $50,581                   | Random Forest |

## 4. Saturation Analysis
### Crossover Analysis
- **Verdict**: The crossover point is at **n = 250**.
- **Implication**: For datasets smaller than 250 samples, deploying a Random Forest is counterproductive compared to a simple Linear Regression.

### Learning Curve DNA (Random Forest)
- **Equation**: $E(n) = a \cdot n^{-\alpha} + b$
- **Learning Rate ($\alpha$)**: 0.2010 (Indicates moderate data efficiency).
- **Irreducible Error ($b$)**: $21,036 (The theoretical limit of this model architecture on this specific task).

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations
1.  **Cold Start Strategy**: For new deployments with < 250 labeled examples, prioritize simple linear models or heuristics.
2.  **Scale-Up Phase**: Switch to Random Forest (or similar complexity) once data exceeds 250 samples.
3.  **Data ROI**: Collecting data beyond 5,000 samples yields diminishing returns, as the model approaches its irreducible error floor.
